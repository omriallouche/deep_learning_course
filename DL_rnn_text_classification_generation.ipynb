    "In the first part of this exercise, we’ll continue our attempts to classify text using different network architectures. This time, we’ll try a LSTM. We'll use the Metrolyrics dataset we used in the previous exercise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to review the code in [this](https://github.com/prakashpandey9/Text-Classification-Pytorch) repo, that contains implementation of several deep learning architectures for text classification in PyTorch. If you face time limitations, you're welcome to adapt it to your needs instead of writing your own code from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of this exercise, you'll unleash the hidden creativity of your computer, by letting it generate Country songs (yeehaw!). You'll train a character-level RNN-based language model, and use it to generate new songs.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Special Note\n",
    "Our Deep Learning course was packed with both theory and practice. In a short time, you've got to learn the basics of deep learning theory and get hands-on experience training and using pretrained DL networks, while learning PyTorch.  \n",
    "Past exercises required a lot of work, and hopefully gave you a sense of the challenges and difficulties one faces when using deep learning in the real world. While the investment you've made in the course so far is enormous, I strongly encourage you to take a stab at this exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "DL networks for NLP are much shallower than those for image classification. It's possible to construct your own networks from scratch, and achieve nice results. While I hope the theoretical foundations of RNNs are clear after our class sessions, getting your hands dirty with their implementation in PyTorch allows you to set breakpoints, watch the dimensions of the different layers and components and get a much better understand of theory, in addition to code that might prove useful later for your own projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "I tried to provide references for all parts that walk you through a very similar task (actually, the same task on a different dataset). I expect this exercise to require much less of your time than previous exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise is aimed to help you get better understanding of the concepts. I am not looking for the optimal model performance, and don't look for extensive optimization of hyperparameters. The task we face in this exercise, namely the classification of the song’s genre from its text alone, is quite challenging, and we probably shouldn’t expect great results from our classifier. Don’t let this discourage you - not every task reaches an f1 score of 90%+. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, some of the reasons I chose this dataset is because it highlights some of the issues we face in machine learning models in the real world. Examples include:\n",
    "- The classes are highly imbalanced - try to think how this affects the network learning\n",
    "- Given the small amount of data for some classes, you might actually prefer to remove them from the dataset. How would you decide that?\n",
    "- NLP tasks often involve preprocessing (lowercasing, tokenization, lemmatization, stopwords removal etc.). The decision on the actual preprocessing pipeline depends on the task, and is often influenced by our believes about the data and exploratory analysis of it. Thinking conciously about these questions helps you be a better data scientist\n",
    "- Some songs contain no lyrics (for example, they just contain the text \"instrumental\"). Others include non-English characters. You'll often need to preprocess your data and make decisions as to what your network should actually get as input (think - how should you treat newline characters?)\n",
    "- While model performance on this dataset are not amazing, we can try to answer interesting follow-up questions - which genres are more similar to each other and are often confused? Do genres become more similar through the years? ...\n",
    "\n",
    "More issues will probably pop up while you're working on this task. If you face technical difficulties or find a step in the process that takes too long, please let me know. It would also be great if you share with the class code you wrote that speeds up some of the work (for example, a data loader class, a parsed dataset etc.)"

    "### Final Tips\n",
    "As a final tip, I do encourage you to do most of the work first on your local machine. They say that Data Scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning the data and preparing it for training (and 20% complaining about cleaning the data and preparing it). Handling these parts on your local machine usually mean you will spend less time complaining. You can switch to the cloud once your code runs and your pipeline is in place, for the actual training using a GPU.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I also encourage you to use a small subset of the dataset first, so things run smoothly. The Metrolyrics dataset contains over 300k songs. You can start with a much much smaller set (even 3,000 songs) and try to train a network based on it. Once everything runs properly, add more data. \n",
